# rapid-concussion-test
Flask application hosting a rapid concussion test using varying sine wave patterns. 

## Run app
To run the flask app locally run the following command in terminal "python3 app.py". This will run the backend python file which runs the website. In terminal you will see that flask provides you with the url to access the site (which can be done through a webrowser). To navigate to the home page of the app you must add "/index.html" to the end of the url that flask provide. Together it should be something like this "http://127.0.0.1:5000/index.html".
